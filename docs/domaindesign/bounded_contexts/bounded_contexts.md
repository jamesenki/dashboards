## Context Relationships

### Context Map

The following describes the relationships between our bounded contexts:

1. **Device Management ⟷ Device Operation**
   - **Relationship Type:** Partnership (bidirectional)
   - **Description:** Device Management provides identity and capability information to Device Operation. Device Operation provides status updates to Device Management.
   - **Integration Method:** Shared Kernel for core device models

2. **Device Operation ⟷ Maintenance Management**
   - **Relationship Type:** Customer-Supplier
   - **Description:** Device Operation is the upstream supplier of telemetry and status data. Maintenance Management is the downstream customer that consumes this data.
   - **Integration Method:** Published Events (telemetry, status changes)

3. **Device Operation ⟷ Energy Management**
   - **Relationship Type:** Customer-Supplier
   - **Description:** Device Operation provides the energy consumption data. Energy Management analyzes and processes this data.
   - **Integration Method:** Published Events (consumption data, state changes)

4. **Maintenance Management ⟷ Analytics & Reporting**
   - **Relationship Type:** Customer-Supplier
   - **Description:** Maintenance Management supplies service history and health predictions. Analytics & Reporting consumes this for trend analysis and reporting.
   - **Integration Method:** Open Host Service (API)

### Anti-Corruption Layers

The following Anti-Corruption Layers (ACLs) protect the integrity of our bounded contexts:

1. **Manufacturer-Agnostic Adapter Layer**
   - **Location:** Between external manufacturer-specific APIs and the Device Management context
   - **Purpose:** Translates varied manufacturer-specific data formats into our canonical model
   - **Implementation:** Adapter pattern using transformation services

2. **Legacy System Integration Layer**
   - **Location:** Between legacy components and all modern bounded contexts
   - **Purpose:** Isolates modern contexts from legacy implementation details
   - **Implementation:** Facade pattern with transformation services

3. **Protocol Adaptation Layer**
   - **Location:** Between various device communication protocols and the Device Operation context
   - **Purpose:** Normalizes different protocols (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP) into a standard internal format
   - **Implementation:** Protocol-specific adapters with a common interface
