# IoTSphere Domain-Driven Design

This directory contains the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) artifacts for the IoTSphere platform. These artifacts define the core domain model, the ubiquitous language, and the design boundaries used throughout the project as we transition to a device-agnostic IoT platform.

## Purpose

The domain design artifacts provided here serve multiple purposes:

1. **Establish a Ubiquitous Language** - Define consistent terminology used by all stakeholders
2. **Define Domain Boundaries** - Create clear bounded contexts with explicit relationships
3. **Model Core Concepts** - Identify entities, value objects, and aggregates central to our domain
4. **Map Business Capabilities** - Align software components with business functions
5. **Guide Implementation** - Provide a blueprint for implementation that follows domain concerns

## Key Artifacts

| Category | Description | File |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Personas | Key users and stakeholders interacting with the system | [personas.md](./personas/personas.md) |
| Bounded Contexts | Domain boundaries with distinct responsibilities | [bounded_contexts.md](./bounded_contexts/bounded_contexts.md) |
| Domain Entities | Primary objects with identity and lifecycle | [domain_entities.md](./entities/domain_entities.md) |
| Domain Aggregates | Clusters of domain objects treated as a unit | [domain_aggregates.md](./aggregates/domain_aggregates.md) |
| Domain Services | Operations that don't naturally fit in entities | [domain_services.md](./services/domain_services.md) |
| Domain Events | Significant occurrences in the domain | [domain_events.md](./events/domain_events.md) |

## Current Focus: Water Heaters

While our domain model encompasses multiple device types in accordance with our device-agnostic vision, the current implementation focus is on water heaters. The domain model reflects:

- **Core Concepts** - Generic device management, operational monitoring, and maintenance applicable to all devices
- **Specialized Concepts** - Water heater specific features like temperature control, heating elements, and tank maintenance
- **Extension Points** - Clear interfaces where new device types will integrate

## Using These Artifacts

These domain design artifacts should be used to:

1. **Guide New Implementation** - When adding features, first check how they fit within the domain model
2. **Refactor Existing Code** - Align current implementation with the domain model when making changes
3. **Define Behavior-Driven Tests** - Create tests that reflect domain concepts and boundaries
4. **Communicate with Stakeholders** - Use the ubiquitous language in all discussions about the system

## Further Development

As we expand to support additional device types beyond water heaters, we will:

1. Update these domain artifacts to include new concepts
2. Refine existing concepts to better support device-agnostic patterns
3. Develop specialized bounded contexts for new device types
4. Enhance the cross-cutting concerns to maintain consistency

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to the domain model:

1. Respect the ubiquitous language - use the established terms consistently
2. Maintain the integrity of bounded contexts - don't mix unrelated concepts
3. Validate changes with domain experts before implementation
4. Update related artifacts when changing one part of the model
