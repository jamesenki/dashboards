The farther you and the your AI Partner wander away from the TDD principles and cycle, the more you will drift away from design

THe AI is a junior programmer and prone to
    Introucting Mock Data
    Introducting "Fixes" that are not needed or instead of correcting the prduction intent code
    The AI seldom cleans up after itself
    It will violate architecture principles, in particular to expidite development
    It will write code that is not maintainable if you are not careful
    it will make too many changes at once
    It will do things like launch an application on a new port rather than the one you want because the application is still running on it

    IF I had this to do over again I would have started with and stuck to only BDD tests, making others ephemeral and only when needed
