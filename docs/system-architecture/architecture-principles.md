# IoTSphere Architecture Principles and Standards

## Overview

This document outlines the core architecture principles and standards that guide the development of the IoTSphere platform. These principles serve as the foundation for our architectural decisions and help ensure a coherent, maintainable, and scalable system.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a fundamental principle of our architecture and development process:

- **Requirements as Tests**: Architecture components must have tests that define their expected behavior before implementation
- **Test Verification**: All architectural changes must be verified through automated tests
- **Continuous Validation**: Architecture must support and facilitate continuous testing
- **Design for Testability**: All components must be designed with testability in mind

### 2. Microservices Architecture

We follow a microservices approach with these guidelines:

- **Service Autonomy**: Each service should be independent with its own data store when practical
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service should have a well-defined and bounded context
- **Loose Coupling**: Services should interact through well-defined APIs with minimal dependencies
- **Independent Deployment**: Services must be deployable independently
- **Resilience**: System should be designed to be resilient to individual service failures
- **Right-Sizing**: Services should be neither too large (monolithic) nor too small (nano-services)

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

For asynchronous operations and integration:

- **Event Sourcing**: Critical state changes should be captured as immutable events
- **Message-Based Communication**: Services should communicate primarily through messages for asynchronous operations
- **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**: Use pub/sub patterns for event distribution
- **Event Streams**: Maintain ordered event streams for critical business processes
- **Idempotent Processing**: Event handlers must be designed for idempotent processing

### 4. API-First Design

For all service interfaces:

- **API Contracts First**: Define API contracts before implementation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility for APIs when possible
- **Versioning Strategy**: Clear versioning strategy for all APIs
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation for all APIs
- **Standardized Patterns**: Consistent patterns and conventions across APIs

### 5. Separation of Concerns

At all levels of the architecture:

- **Layered Architecture**: Clearly separate presentation, business logic, and data access
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Abstract common concerns (logging, authentication, etc.) into dedicated components
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code around business domains rather than technical functions
- **Bounded Contexts**: Define clear boundaries between different parts of the system

### 6. Security by Design

Security must be integral, not an afterthought:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components should have only the access rights they need
- **Secure Communication**: All service-to-service communication must be secured
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Consistent approach to user and service authentication

### 7. Scalability and Performance

Design for growth:

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Services should scale horizontally rather than vertically
- **Statelessness**: Prefer stateless services where possible
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching at multiple levels
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use asynchronous processing for non-critical paths
- **Database Scaling**: Plan for database scalability with proper sharding/partitioning strategies

### 8. Observability

Ensure comprehensive monitoring:

- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all services
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement trace context propagation across services
- **Health Monitoring**: Clear health check endpoints for all services
- **Metrics Collection**: Standardized metrics collection for performance and business KPIs
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerting based on service health and performance

## Implementation Standards

### Service Communication

- **REST**: Use RESTful APIs for synchronous service-to-service communication
- **Message Queue**: Use RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication
- **Data Format**: JSON for all API payloads unless specific performance requirements dictate otherwise

### Data Storage

- **Operational Data**: MongoDB for flexible document-based storage
- **Time Series Data**: InfluxDB for telemetry and metric storage
- **Caching**: Redis for distributed caching
- **Database Patterns**:
  * Apply Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for complex domains
  * Use database-per-service when appropriate

### API Standards

- **RESTful Conventions**:
  * Follow REST resource naming conventions
  * Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  * Return appropriate status codes
- **GraphQL**: Use for complex data querying needs
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specification for all REST APIs

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Identity Provider**: Centralized identity provider with OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for service-to-service authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement RBAC for authorization
- **API Gateway**: Centralized authentication at API gateway

### Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: All services deployed as containers
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying services
- **Environment Parity**: Development, testing, and production environments should be as similar as possible

### Error Handling

- **Consistent Error Format**: Standard error response format across all services
- **Graceful Degradation**: Services should degrade gracefully when dependencies fail
- **Circuit Breaking**: Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- **Retry Policies**: Clear retry policies for transient failures

## Architecture Decision Process

Architecture decisions should follow this process:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clearly define the problem being addressed
2. **Constraints**: Identify technical, business, and operational constraints
3. **Options Analysis**: Evaluate multiple options against the principles and constraints
4. **Decision**: Document the decision and rationale in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
5. **Validation**: Validate the decision through prototyping or proof of concept
6. **Implementation**: Implement with appropriate tests
7. **Review**: Review the effectiveness of the decision after implementation

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

All significant architecture decisions must be documented in ADRs:

- **Template**: Use the standard ADR template
- **Location**: Store in the `/docs/adr` directory
- **Referencing**: Reference ADRs in code and documentation where appropriate
- **Status**: Clearly mark the status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)

## Automated Architecture Governance

Rather than relying on manual reviews, we take an automated and continuous approach to architecture governance:

1. **Automated Architecture Validation**:
   - Static analysis tools that verify adherence to architectural patterns
   - Architectural fitness functions in CI/CD pipeline
   - Automated dependency analysis to enforce boundaries
   - Style checkers that validate architectural conformance

2. **Continuous Technical Debt Monitoring**:
   - Automated identification of architecture smells
   - Metrics collection for architectural complexity
   - Automated reports of component coupling and cohesion
   - Trend analysis of architecture quality indicators

3. **Exception-Based Manual Reviews**:
   - Manual architecture reviews only for complex ADRs that can't be easily decided
   - Team review sessions for significant architectural changes
   - Focus on contentious decisions rather than routine governance

4. **Automated Refactoring Triggers**:
   - Threshold-based triggers for architectural refactoring
   - Automatic creation of refactoring tickets when metrics exceed thresholds
   - Integration with sprint planning to ensure technical debt is addressed

5. **Continuous Architecture Documentation**:
   - Automated diagram generation from code
   - Documentation validation in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Automatic synchronization between code and architecture documents

## Conclusion

These architecture principles and standards guide our development efforts and ensure that the IoTSphere platform remains maintainable, scalable, and aligned with business needs. All team members should be familiar with these principles and apply them in their work.

By following these principles, we ensure that the architecture evolves in a consistent and deliberate manner, enabling the platform to meet both current requirements and future challenges.
