# IoTSphere Architecture Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the IoTSphere platform architecture. IoTSphere is a modern IoT platform that enables users to manage connected devices, collect and analyze sensor data, and receive alerts based on predefined conditions. The architecture documentation follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring that the architecture evolves in a maintainable and verifiable way.

## Architectural Approach

The IoTSphere platform follows these key architectural principles:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Dividing the system into independent, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Using message queues for asynchronous communication between services, enabling resilience and scalability.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Following the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for all new features and changes.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different system components, making the system easier to test and maintain.
5. **API-First Design**: Well-defined APIs for all services, enabling independent development and testing.

## System Context

## Sequence Diagrams

### Device Onboarding Sequence

This sequence diagram illustrates the process of onboarding a new device to the IoTSphere platform.

The onboarding process involves:
1. Admin initiates device onboarding through the web application
2. The API server forwards the request to the Device Management Service
3. The Provisioning Manager creates the device in the Device Registry
4. Default configuration is created for the device
5. Device credentials are generated and stored
6. The admin applies the provisioning package to the device
7. The device connects to the platform using the credentials
8. The device connection is verified and confirmed

### Data Processing and Alerting Sequence

This sequence diagram shows how device data is processed and how alerts are generated.

![Data Processing and Alerting Sequence](diagrams/sequence_data_processing.png)

The data processing flow includes:
1. IoT device publishes telemetry data to the Message Queue
2. Data Processor consumes the message, validates and normalizes the data
3. Processed data is stored in the Time Series Database
4. Data is forwarded to the Alert Engine for analysis
5. Alert Engine evaluates alert rules against historical data
6. If an alert threshold is exceeded, a notification is triggered
7. Subscribers to the alert are notified
8. The alert event is stored in the database

### Maintenance Prediction Sequence

This sequence diagram illustrates how maintenance predictions are generated for devices.

The maintenance prediction process involves:
1. User opens the maintenance dashboard in the web application
2. The application requests maintenance predictions from the API server
3. The Monitoring Service forwards the request to the Analytics Engine
4. The Analytics Engine queries historical data from the Time Series Database
5. The Analytics Engine requests predictions from the Model Monitoring Service
6. The Performance Monitor evaluates device health
7. The Maintenance Predictions Module generates predictions
8. Results are returned to the web application and displayed to the user

## Test-Driven Development Approach

All architectural components are developed following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests that define expected functionality
   - Define expected component interactions
   - Specify required interfaces and behaviors
   - Create tests that verify these expectations

2. **GREEN Phase**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
   - Implement the components with minimal features
   - Focus on satisfying the test requirements
   - Ensure all tests pass before moving forward

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests
   - Enhance performance, readability, and maintainability
   - Apply design patterns and best practices
   - Verify that all tests still pass after refactoring

This approach ensures that the architecture evolves in a maintainable, verifiable way, with clear requirements and high test coverage.

## Integration and Deployment

The IoTSphere platform can be deployed in various environments:

1. **Development**: Local Docker-based deployment for development and testing
2. **Staging**: Cloud-based deployment for integration testing
3. **Production**: Fully scalable Kubernetes deployment

The deployment process follows these principles:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined in code and version-controlled
2. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and building of components
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to environments
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging of all components

## Conclusion

The IoTSphere architecture provides a scalable, maintainable foundation for IoT device management and monitoring. By following Test-Driven Development principles, the architecture ensures that all components are well-tested and meet requirements. The microservices approach allows for independent development and deployment of components, making the system flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.
