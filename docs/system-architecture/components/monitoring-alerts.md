# IoTSphere-Refactor Model Monitoring & Alerts Architecture

## Overview

The IoTSphere-Refactor Model Monitoring & Alerts system provides a comprehensive solution for tracking ML model performance metrics, detecting drift and degradation, and alerting on potential model issues. This document describes the architecture and data flow of the monitoring alerts subsystem in the refactored backend.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Structure

The monitoring system uses a SQLite database with several key tables:

- **models**: Stores information about ML models being monitored
  - Columns: `id`, `name`, `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `archived`
- **alert_rules**: Defines conditions that trigger alerts
  - Columns: `id`, `model_id`, `metric_name`, `threshold`, `condition`, `severity`, `created_at`, `active`
- **alert_events**: Records instances when alert rules are triggered
  - Columns: `id`, `rule_id`, `model_id`, `metric_name`, `metric_value`, `severity`, `created_at`, `resolved`, `resolved_at`

### 2. Backend Components

- **ModelMetricsRepository**: Responsible for retrieving model metrics and alert data
  - Handles database queries and can fall back to mock data when necessary
  - Implements TDD principles by adapting to expected test behaviors
- **ModelMonitoringService**: Provides business logic for monitoring operations
  - Acts as a service layer between the API and data repositories
- **DashboardAPI**: Exposes HTTP endpoints for monitoring dashboard functionality
  - Formats data to match frontend expectations

### 3. API Components

- **Monitoring Router**: FastAPI router that exposes monitoring endpoints
  - `/api/monitoring/metrics`: Provides model performance metrics
  - `/api/monitoring/alerts`: Returns active and historical alert data
  - `/api/monitoring/health`: Summarized model health status information
- **Response Models**: Pydantic models for structured API responses
  - Ensures consistent data formats for client applications
  - Provides automatic validation and documentation

## Alert Flow

1. Alert rules are defined in the configuration (YAML files based on environment)
2. The ModelMonitoringService evaluates incoming metrics against these rules
3. When a threshold is violated, an alert is generated and stored in the database
4. Alerts are made available through the API endpoints
5. Alert status can be updated through the API

## Alert Processing Flow

1. Model metrics are collected by the ModelMonitoringService
2. Metrics are stored in the database via the ModelMetricsRepository
3. The monitoring service evaluates metrics against configured thresholds
4. If thresholds are exceeded, alert records are created
5. API endpoints expose this alert data to client applications

*Note: A sequence diagram specific to the refactored implementation should be created to replace the original diagram.*

## Implementation Details

### Alert Rule Definition

Alert rules are defined with:
- A metric name to monitor
- A threshold value
- A comparison operator (>, <, =, etc.)
- A severity level (info, warning, critical)

### Alert Processing

When new metrics are received:
1. The system retrieves applicable alert rules
2. Each rule is evaluated against the metric value
3. If a rule is triggered, an alert event is created
4. The alert is stored in the database
5. Notification services are informed

### Alert Resolution

Alerts can be resolved:
- Automatically when metrics return to normal levels
- Manually by users through the dashboard interface

## Testing Approach

Following TDD principles, the alert system is developed with comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components like rule evaluation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire alert flow from trigger to notification

Each test case defines expected behaviors before implementation, ensuring the system meets requirements.
