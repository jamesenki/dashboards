# ADR 006: SQL Injection Prevention

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-03-28

## Context
The IoTSphere platform interacts with a database for various operations, including storing and retrieving model training schedules, user data, and system configurations. SQL injection attacks remain one of the most common and dangerous security vulnerabilities in applications that use SQL databases. Following our commitment to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, we need a comprehensive approach to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities while ensuring our tests continue to pass.

## Decision
We will implement a two-layer approach to SQL injection prevention:

1. **SQLSecurityValidator**: A dedicated class to validate SQL queries and parameters for potential SQL injection patterns
2. **DataAccess Layer**: A secure abstraction over database operations that enforces parameterized queries and validation

The SQLSecurityValidator will:
- Detect common SQL injection patterns using regex
- Validate both direct queries and parameter values
- Support whitelisting known-safe query patterns
- Differentiate between parameterized and non-parameterized queries in its validation

The DataAccess Layer will:
- Provide a consistent interface for all database operations
- Automatically validate all queries using the SQLSecurityValidator
- Use parameterized queries for all variable data
- Enforce best practices for different types of operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

This implementation will follow TDD principles, with tests defining the security requirements before implementation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- SQL injection vulnerabilities will be systematically prevented
- Centralized security validation provides consistent protection
- Abstracted database access simplifies secure usage across the codebase
- Test-driven approach ensures requirements are met before implementation
- Parameterized queries improve performance through query plan caching

### Negative
- Additional validation layer may slightly impact performance
- Developers must follow the new abstraction pattern rather than direct SQL
- Existing code needs to be refactored to use the new approach

### Neutral
- We will need to maintain a list of SQL injection patterns to detect
- Whitelisted patterns must be carefully reviewed before approval

## Compliance
This decision supports our compliance with:
- OWASP Top 10 (A1:2017 - Injection)
- CWE-89: SQL Injection
- NIST Special Publication 800-53 (SI-10 Information Input Validation)

## Implementation Approach
Following our TDD principles:

1. Create tests that define expected SQL security behaviors
2. Implement SQLSecurityValidator to pass the tests
3. Implement DataAccess layer using the validator
4. Refactor existing code to use the new secure approach
5. Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all security aspects
