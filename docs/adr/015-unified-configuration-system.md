# ADR 015: Unified Configuration System

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The IoTSphere platform currently uses a mixed approach for configuration management:

1. Some settings (like database connections) are configurable via environment variables
2. Mock data responses and API endpoints are largely hardcoded
3. No consistent pattern exists for managing configuration across different components

This inconsistency creates several issues:

- Difficulty in deploying to different environments (development, staging, production)
- Challenges in testing components with different configurations
- Maintenance overhead when configuration needs to change
- Potential security risks with hardcoded values

Our architecture principles emphasize separation of concerns, API-first design, and testability - all of which are impacted by our current configuration approach.

## Decision

We will implement a unified configuration system with the following characteristics:

1. **Hierarchical Configuration Sources**:
   - Default values in code
   - Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
   - Environment variables (highest priority)

2. **Modular Configuration**:
   - Separate configuration namespaces for different system components
   - Clear validation and schema definition for each component's configuration

3. **Configuration Service**:
   - Centralized service for accessing configuration
   - Runtime configuration update capabilities where appropriate
   - Configuration change auditing

4. **Configuration-Based Resource Locations**:
   - Data source endpoints and credentials
   - API base paths and versioning
   - External service endpoints

5. **Externalized Mock Data**:
   - Move hardcoded mock responses to external files
   - Support for environment-specific mock data

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved deployability across different environments
- Better testability through easily swappable configurations
- Reduction in hardcoded values improves security and maintainability
- Consistent configuration pattern across the system
- Support for runtime configuration changes where appropriate
- Better separation of concerns with configuration isolated from business logic

### Negative

- Initial development overhead to implement the configuration system
- Learning curve for developers to understand the new configuration approach
- Potential for increased complexity in configuration management
- Need for careful validation to prevent configuration errors

### Neutral

- Existing codebase needs refactoring to use the new configuration system
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the new approach

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow our TDD approach:

1. Define configuration schemas and validation rules first
2. Create tests for the configuration service before implementation
3. Implement the configuration service
4. Refactor existing components to use the new configuration system
5. Update documentation to reflect the new approach
