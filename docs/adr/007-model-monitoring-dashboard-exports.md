# ADR 007: Model Monitoring Dashboard with PDF/CSV Export Functionality

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The IoTSphere system requires robust model monitoring capabilities to track the performance of ML models over time. Users need to visualize performance metrics, detect drift, and generate shareable reports of this information. A critical requirement is the ability to export these reports in standard formats (PDF and CSV) for sharing with team members, inclusion in documentation, and compliance purposes.

Options considered for export functionality:
1. Client-side generation of exports using JavaScript libraries
2. Server-side generation with Python libraries
3. Third-party export service integration
4. Simple text-based exports without formatting

## Decision
We will implement server-side generation of PDF and CSV exports using Python libraries, specifically:

1. ReportLab for generating professionally formatted PDF reports
2. Native Python CSV module for generating CSV exports
3. FastAPI endpoints for delivering these exports to the client

The implementation will:
1. Follow TDD principles with tests driving the development of the export functionality
2. Provide consistent formatting across different report types (performance, drift, alerts)
3. Include rich data visualization in PDF reports
4. Structure CSV exports for easy data analysis

## Rationale

### Server-side Generation Benefits
- Produces consistent, high-quality documents regardless of client browser capabilities
- Minimizes client-side processing requirements
- Leverages Python's mature libraries for document generation
- Centralizes report generation logic

### Test-Driven Development Integration
- Tests define the expected behavior of export functionality before implementation
- Ensures API endpoints and document generation meet requirements
- Facilitates incremental development and prevents regressions

### Implementation Considerations
- ReportLab's open-source edition provides comprehensive PDF generation capabilities
- Native CSV module eliminates additional dependencies for tabular data exports
- FastAPI framework efficiently delivers binary content with appropriate headers
- Clear separation between data retrieval and document formatting

## Implementation Details
- API endpoints for PDF and CSV exports (`/reports/export/pdf` and `/reports/export/csv`)
- Report templates customized based on report type (performance, drift, alerts)
- Proper MIME type and content disposition headers for browser download handling
- Error handling for missing data or generation failures
- Integration with existing model monitoring data sources

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Users can easily share and archive model monitoring information
- Standardized report formats improve communication across teams
- PDF exports include visualizations that enhance understanding of model performance
- CSV exports support further data analysis in other tools
- Implementation follows project's TDD principles

### Negative Consequences
- Requires installation of additional Python libraries (ReportLab)
- Server bears responsibility for document generation processing
- PDF formatting must be maintained separately from web UI styling
- Limited ability to customize export formats at runtime
