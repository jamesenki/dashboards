# ADR 005: Secure Model Loading Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-03-28

## Context

The IoTSphere application utilizes MLflow for machine learning model management and deployment. Recent security analysis identified potential vulnerabilities related to the ML model loading process, specifically:

1. **Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2023-38345)**: MLflow's model loading functionality could potentially execute arbitrary code if malicious model files are loaded.
2. **Untrusted Model Sources**: No verification of model sources, allowing models from potentially malicious locations to be loaded.
3. **Lack of Model Signature Verification**: Models without cryptographic signatures could be loaded, providing no guarantees about the model's integrity or authenticity.

These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system by providing specially crafted model files or tampering with existing models.

## Decision

We implemented a comprehensive security wrapper around MLflow's model loading functionality with multiple layers of defense:

1. **SecureModelLoader Class**: A secure wrapper that implements multiple security controls:
   - Source verification - only loading models from trusted directories
   - Malicious code detection - analyzing model files for suspicious patterns
   - Signature verification - ensuring models have valid cryptographic signatures
   - Sandbox execution - optionally loading models in an isolated environment

2. **Test-Driven Development Approach**: Implemented comprehensive tests that define security requirements first, then validated implementation against those requirements.

3. **Separation of Dependencies**: Created modular requirements files to manage dependencies more effectively and reduce vulnerabilities.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved Security**: Multiple defense layers make it significantly harder for attackers to exploit model loading.
- **Clear Security Requirements**: Tests define expected security behaviors, making requirements explicit and verifiable.
- **Future Security Upgrades**: The modular approach makes it easier to enhance security measures in the future.
- **Auditability**: Security measures are well-documented and testable, making security audits more straightforward.

### Negative

- **Increased Complexity**: The security wrapper adds another layer to the system architecture.
- **Performance Impact**: Security checks add overhead to the model loading process.
- **Dependency Management**: Need to maintain compatibility with MLflow versions while ensuring security.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Model Format**: Creating a custom, secure model format exclusive to IoTSphere. Rejected due to development time and loss of MLflow's ecosystem benefits.

2. **Container Isolation**: Running all model inference in completely isolated containers. Partially implemented with the sandbox option, but full container isolation was deemed too resource-intensive for all models.

3. **Abandoning MLflow**: Switching to a different ML framework with better security. Rejected due to significant codebase changes required and MLflow's industry adoption.

## Implementation Notes

The implementation follows defense-in-depth principles with multiple security layers:

1. **Source Verification**: Models are only loaded from explicitly whitelisted directories
2. **Static Analysis**: Model files are analyzed for suspicious patterns before loading
3. **Signature Verification**: Models must have valid signatures (can be bypassed in specific cases)
4. **Sandbox Execution**: Optional execution in a restricted environment

All security measures are implemented in a way that allows control over which measures are applied in different contexts, balancing security and functionality.
