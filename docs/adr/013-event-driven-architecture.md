# 13. Event-Driven Architecture for IoT Platform

Date: 2025-04-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The IoTSphere platform needs to handle real-time events from potentially thousands of IoT devices, process those events through various services, and provide real-time updates to user interfaces. Our previous architecture used a more synchronous, request-response approach that created several challenges:

1. Limited scalability for handling many concurrent device events
2. Tight coupling between components, making changes difficult
3. Inconsistent real-time updates to user interfaces
4. Difficulty implementing cross-device orchestration
5. Poor fault tolerance when services fail

The BDD tests require real-time operational monitoring, cross-device analytics, and responsive UI updates, which demand a more event-driven architecture.

## Decision

We will implement an event-driven architecture with a central message bus:

1. **Central Message Bus** (Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ):
   - Acts as the communication backbone for the entire system
   - Provides reliable, ordered message delivery with persistence
   - Supports pub/sub patterns for flexible component integration

2. **Event Producers**:
   - Devices publish telemetry and state changes
   - Services publish state changes and notifications
   - System components publish lifecycle events

3. **Event Consumers**:
   - Services subscribe to relevant event topics
   - Processing pipelines consume and transform events
   - Analytics engines process event streams

4. **WebSocket Service**:
   - Bridges between server events and client UI
   - Maintains persistent connections to browsers
   - Provides real-time updates to dashboards

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Scalability**: Components can scale independently based on event load
2. **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via events without direct dependencies
3. **Better Responsiveness**: Real-time updates flow naturally through the system
4. **Enhanced Resilience**: System can handle component failures more gracefully
5. **Simplified Cross-Service Integration**: Common event format enables easy integration

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**: Event-driven systems require careful design and monitoring
2. **Eventually Consistent**: Data may not be immediately consistent across all views
3. **Debugging Challenges**: Event flows can be harder to trace than direct calls
4. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to adjust to asynchronous programming patterns

### Mitigations

1. We will implement an event schema registry to enforce consistent event formats
2. Comprehensive logging and tracing will track event flows through the system
3. We'll develop testing utilities specifically for event-driven components
4. Clear documentation will explain event flows and consistency expectations

## Compliance with TDD Principles

This decision supports our TDD approach by:

1. Enabling focused tests for event producers and consumers independently
2. Supporting asynchronous test patterns that verify event flows
3. Allowing tests to simulate various event sequences and timing
4. Facilitating integration tests that verify end-to-end event processing

Our BDD tests will define the expected behavior in terms of outcomes, and our implementation will use events to achieve those outcomes in a scalable, loosely-coupled manner.

## Alternative Options Considered

1. **REST API Synchronous Communication**:
   - Pros: Simpler development model, direct request-response
   - Cons: Limited scalability, tighter coupling, less real-time capability
   - Rejected because: Cannot achieve required responsiveness and scale

2. **Point-to-Point Messaging Without Central Bus**:
   - Pros: Potentially simpler initial implementation
   - Cons: Creates a complex web of direct dependencies, harder to evolve
   - Rejected because: Creates maintenance and scaling challenges

3. **GraphQL with Subscriptions**:
   - Pros: Structured query language with real-time capabilities
   - Cons: More complex to implement at scale, still creates coupling
   - Rejected because: Not as well-suited for high-volume machine-to-machine communication
