# MLOps Implementation Plan for IoTSphere

## Next Steps
3. Consider adding these additional MLOps enhancements:
   - Automated model retraining based on feedback patterns
   - Model monitoring dashboard to track performance metrics
   - Feature drift detection to identify when models need retraining
   - A/B testing framework to compare model performance in production

## Current State Assessment

From our work with the codebase, we can see that:

1. The system has several prediction models (component failure, usage patterns, etc.)
2. The API interface for serving predictions is in place
3. The basic model implementations exist but may be using static or simulated logic

## What's Missing in the Current MLOps Infrastructure

1. **Feedback Loop System**: No mechanism to collect feedback on prediction accuracy
2. **Model Versioning**: No clear versioning system for deployed models
3. **Automated Retraining Pipeline**: No automated process to retrain models with new data
4. **Model Performance Monitoring**: No metrics collection on prediction quality
5. **Feature Store**: No centralized repository for training features

## Proposed MLOps Implementation

### 1. Feedback Collection System

```python
class PredictionFeedbackService:
    """Service for collecting feedback on prediction accuracy"""
    
    def record_prediction_outcome(self, prediction_id: str, actual_outcome: dict, 
                                 feedback_source: str):
        """
        Record the actual outcome related to a prediction
        
        Args:
            prediction_id: ID of the prediction to associate feedback with
            actual_outcome: What actually happened (compared to prediction)
            feedback_source: Source of feedback (technician, sensor, user)
        """
        # Implementation to store feedback in database
        
    def record_user_feedback(self, prediction_id: str, feedback_rating: int, 
                           comments: str = None):
        """
        Record subjective user feedback on prediction quality
        
        Args:
            prediction_id: ID of the prediction
            feedback_rating: Rating (1-5) of prediction accuracy
            comments: Optional text feedback
        """
        # Implementation to store user feedback
```

### 2. Model Registry

```python
class MLModelRegistry:
    """Registry for managing ML model versions and deployments"""
    
    def register_model(self, model_name: str, model_version: str, 
                     model_artifacts_path: str, metadata: dict = None):
        """Register a new model version"""
        # Implementation
        
    def get_active_model(self, model_name: str, device_type: str = None):
        """Get currently active model for a prediction type"""
        # Implementation
        
    def promote_model_to_production(self, model_name: str, model_version: str):
        """Promote a specific model version to production"""
        # Implementation
        
    def rollback_model(self, model_name: str, to_version: str = None):
        """Rollback to previous version or specific version"""
        # Implementation
```

### 3. Automated Training Pipeline

```python
class ModelTrainingPipeline:
    """Pipeline for automated model training"""
    
    def trigger_model_training(self, model_name: str, 
                             training_data_start_date: datetime = None,
                             training_data_end_date: datetime = None):
        """Trigger training for a specific model"""
        # Implementation
        
    def schedule_regular_training(self, model_name: str, 
                                schedule: str = "monthly"):
        """Set up regular training schedule"""
        # Implementation
        
    def evaluate_model_performance(self, model_name: str, model_version: str,
                                 test_dataset_id: str = None):
        """Evaluate model performance on test dataset"""
        # Implementation
```

### 4. Model Performance Monitoring

```python
class ModelPerformanceMonitor:
    """Monitor deployed model performance"""
    
    def track_prediction_metrics(self, prediction_type: str, 
                               metrics: dict, timestamp: datetime):
        """Record performance metrics for a prediction type"""
        # Implementation
        
    def detect_model_drift(self, model_name: str):
        """Detect if model performance is degrading over time"""
        # Implementation
        
    def generate_performance_report(self, model_name: str = None, 
                                  time_period: str = "last_month"):
        """Generate performance report for stakeholders"""
        # Implementation
```

### 5. Feature Store

```python
class FeatureStore:
    """Centralized repository for ML features"""
    
    def store_device_features(self, device_id: str, features: dict, 
                            timestamp: datetime):
        """Store features for a device at a point in time"""
        # Implementation
        
    def get_training_dataset(self, feature_names: list, 
                           start_date: datetime, end_date: datetime,
                           device_type: str = None):
        """Get dataset for training"""
        # Implementation
        
    def get_device_features(self, device_id: str, 
                          feature_names: list = None,
                          time_range: tuple = None):
        """Get features for a specific device"""
        # Implementation    
```

## Integration with Existing System

To integrate with the existing prediction service, we should:

1. Enhance the PredictionService to include feedback collection
2. Modify the prediction API to record which model version generated each prediction
3. Update the IoTSphere dashboard to allow user feedback on predictions
4. Implement a background worker for model training and evaluation
5. Create admin interfaces for MLOps monitoring and control

## Database Schema Extensions

We'll need to add tables for:

- Prediction feedback and outcomes
- Model versions and performance metrics
- Training datasets and results
- Feature store time-series data

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (1-2 months):
- Implement basic feedback collection
- Set up model versioning
- Create initial feature store

### Phase 2 (2-3 months):
- Build automated training pipeline
- Implement performance monitoring
- Develop admin dashboard for MLOps

### Phase 3 (Ongoing):
- Refine models based on feedback
- Expand feature store with new data sources
- Implement advanced drift detection

## Test-Driven Development Approach

Following IoTSphere's TDD principles, we'll implement the MLOps system by:

1. Writing tests first for each component
2. Implementing the minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactoring for code quality while ensuring tests continue to pass

This will ensure our MLOps infrastructure is robust and maintainable.

## API Integration

The MLOps components will integrate with the existing prediction API endpoints that follow the pattern `/api/predictions/water-heaters/{device_id}/{prediction-type}` and will augment them with feedback collection capabilities and model versioning information.

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in the database.
2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control for MLOps components.
3. **Model Security**: Implement security measures for ML models, such as model validation and model versioning.
4. **Model Validation**: Implement model validation to ensure that models are not malicious.
5. **Model Versioning**: Implement model versioning to ensure that models are not malicious.
6. **Model Signature**: Implement model signature to ensure that models are not malicious.
7. **Model Loading**: Implement model loading to ensure that models are not malicious.
8. **Model Execution**: Implement model execution to ensure that models are not malicious.
9. **Model Deployment**: Implement model deployment to ensure that models are not malicious.
10. **Model Monitoring**: Implement model monitoring to ensure that models are not malicious.
11. **Model Auditing**: Implement model auditing to ensure that models are not malicious.
12. **Model Logging**: Implement model logging to ensure that models are not malicious.
13. **Model Logging**: Implement model logging to ensure that models are not malicious.
14. **Model Logging**: Implement model logging to ensure that models are not malicious.
15. **Model Logging**: Implement model logging to ensure that models are not malicious.
