# Water Heater Operations Dashboard

## Overview

The Water Heater Operations Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of water heater performance, status, and maintenance needs. This dashboard follows Test-Driven Development principles and is designed to give users real-time insights into their water heater fleet.

## Features

### 1. Status Overview

- **Health Status Indicators**: Visual representation of water heater operational state
- **Performance Metrics**: Key metrics like temperature, pressure, and energy consumption
- **Alert Indicators**: Prominent display of active alerts and warnings

### 2. Operational Monitoring

- **Temperature Monitoring**: Real-time and historical temperature data
- **Pressure Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of system pressure
- **Flow Rate Analysis**: Water flow monitoring with anomaly detection
- **Energy Usage**: Consumption patterns and efficiency metrics

### 3. Maintenance Planning

- **Predictive Maintenance**: AI-driven predictions of maintenance needs
- **Component Health**: Status of critical components (heating elements, valves, etc.)
- **Service History**: Record of past maintenance activities
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Calendar view of upcoming maintenance tasks

### 4. Performance Analytics
