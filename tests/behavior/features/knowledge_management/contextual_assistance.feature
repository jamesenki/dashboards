Feature: AI-Assisted Knowledge Management and Troubleshooting
  As a Service Technician or Facility Manager
  I want contextual knowledge and troubleshooting assistance
  So that I can efficiently resolve issues and maintain devices

  @future @ai-capability @ai-learning @persona-technician
  Scenario: Receive contextual troubleshooting assistance
    Given a water heater with an error code "E-41"
    When a service technician requests troubleshooting assistance
    Then the system should provide:
      | errorDescription   | What the error code means                    |
      | possibleCauses     | Ranked list of potential causes              |
      | diagnosticSteps    | Step-by-step diagnostic procedure            |
      | requiredTools      | Tools needed for diagnosis and repair        |
      | estimatedTimeToFix | Expected time to complete the repair         |
      | partRequirements   | Parts that might need replacement            |
    And the assistance should be specific to the device model
    And the information should include diagrams or visual guides
    And solutions should be ranked by probability of resolving the issue

  @future @ai-capability @ai-learning @persona-technician
  Scenario: AI learns from successful maintenance patterns
    Given multiple service records for similar issues across devices
    And information about which repair approaches were successful
    When the knowledge system processes this historical data
    Then it should identify the most effective repair procedures
    And it should update its recommendations based on success rates
    And it should detect patterns in successful troubleshooting approaches
    And future recommendations should prioritize approaches with higher success rates

  @future @ai-capability @cross-device @persona-facilityman
  Scenario: Cross-device knowledge application
    Given a new device type is added to the system
    And it shares capabilities with existing device types
    When a user encounters an issue with the new device type
    Then the system should apply relevant knowledge from similar capabilities
    And it should adapt troubleshooting procedures from other device types
    And it should identify which aspects are device-specific
    And it should generate appropriate guidance despite limited historical data

  @future @ai-capability @ai-learning @persona-technician
  Scenario: Capture and integrate field knowledge
    Given a service technician resolves an unusual issue
    When they document their solution in the system
    Then the knowledge management system should:
      | extractKeyInsights   | Identify the key troubleshooting steps    |
      | categorizeKnowledge  | Associate with specific error conditions  |
      | validateApproach     | Compare with existing knowledge           |
      | integrateKnowledge   | Add to the knowledge base                 |
      | creditContributor    | Record who provided the knowledge         |
    And the new knowledge should be available for future similar issues
    And other technicians should benefit from the captured expertise

  @future @ai-capability @ai-learning @persona-technician @persona-facilityman
  Scenario: Predictive troubleshooting guidance
    Given a device with unusual telemetry patterns
    When the predictive maintenance system detects a developing issue
    Then it should proactively generate troubleshooting guidance
    And the guidance should address the specific emerging issue
    And it should include preventative steps to avoid failure
    And it should estimate the urgency of intervention
    And it should recommend optimal timing for maintenance
    And it should estimate resource requirements for resolution

  @future @ai-capability @ai-business-intelligence @persona-facilityman
  Scenario: Knowledge-based operational improvements
    Given accumulated knowledge about device operations and maintenance
    When the business intelligence system analyzes this knowledge
    Then it should identify opportunities for operational improvements such as:
      | trainingOpportunities| Areas where staff training could help      |
      | processImprovements  | Maintenance processes that could be improved|
      | commonIssues         | Frequently occurring problems to address   |
      | bestPractices        | Operational practices to implement         |
    And each improvement should include an estimated impact
    And implementation guidance should be provided
    And training materials should be automatically suggested
