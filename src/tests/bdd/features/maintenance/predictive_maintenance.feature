Feature: Predictive Maintenance for Water Heaters
  As a maintenance manager
  I want to receive predictive maintenance alerts
  So that I can proactively service water heaters before they fail

  # RED PHASE: Define expected behavior for basic anomaly detection
  @current @maintenance @ai-capability @predictive @red
  Scenario: Detect anomaly in water heater performance
    Given a water heater with ID "wh-001" is being monitored
    When the water heater reports the following telemetry data:
      | temperature | pressure | flow_rate | power_consumption |
      | 155         | 62       | 3.2       | 4500              |
    Then the system should detect an anomaly
    And an alert should be generated with severity "WARNING"
    And the alert should include the detected anomaly type

  # RED PHASE: Define expected behavior for predictive failure analysis
  @current @maintenance @ai-capability @predictive @red
  Scenario: Predict component failure based on historical patterns
    Given a water heater with ID "wh-001" has historical performance data
    When the predictive maintenance model analyzes the telemetry trends
    And the failure probability exceeds 70%
    Then a maintenance recommendation should be generated
    And the recommendation should identify the specific component at risk
    And the recommendation should include estimated time to failure

  # RED PHASE: Define expected behavior for maintenance scheduling
  @current @maintenance @business-intelligence @red
  Scenario: Schedule maintenance based on predictions
    Given a water heater with ID "wh-001" has a pending maintenance recommendation
    And the system has access to technician availability
    When I request an optimal maintenance schedule
    Then the system should propose maintenance time slots
    And the proposed schedule should be before the predicted failure date
    And the schedule should include estimated parts and labor requirements

  # RED PHASE: Define expected behavior for ROI calculation
  @current @maintenance @business-intelligence @red
  Scenario: Calculate ROI for predictive vs. reactive maintenance
    Given a water heater with ID "wh-001" has a pending maintenance recommendation
    When I view the business impact analysis
    Then I should see the cost of predictive maintenance
    And I should see the estimated cost of reactive repair after failure
    And I should see the calculated ROI percentage
    And I should see the estimated downtime comparison

  # RED PHASE: Define expected behavior for multi-device pattern recognition
  @future @maintenance @ai-capability @learning @cross-device @red
  Scenario: Identify maintenance patterns across multiple devices
    Given the system has performance data for multiple water heaters
    When the AI analytics process runs
    Then the system should identify common failure patterns
    And the system should generate a fleet health report
    And the report should include recommendations for systemic improvements
    And the report should prioritize devices by maintenance urgency
