# Security Testing Documentation

## TDD Approach to Security Testing
All security tests in IoTSphere follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. **Red**: Write failing tests that define expected security behavior
2. **Green**: Implement the minimal code required to pass the tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve implementation while ensuring tests continue to pass

This ensures our security measures meet requirements defined by tests, not the other way around.

## Security Test Suites

### SQL Injection Prevention Tests
The `test_sql_security.py` file verifies protection against SQL injection attacks:

#### Test Cases
- **Detection of Unsafe Queries**: Tests the system's ability to identify potentially malicious SQL queries
- **Parameterized Query Validation**: Ensures proper use of parameterized queries for all database operations
- **Input Sanitization**: Verifies that user input is properly sanitized before use in SQL statements
- **Whitelisting**: Tests the whitelist feature for known-safe query patterns

#### Implementation Components
- **SQLSecurityValidator**: Analyzes queries for injection patterns (`src/security/sql_security.py`)
- **DataAccess Layer**: Provides secure database interface with automatic query validation (`src/db/data_access.py`)

#### Best Practices Enforced
- Always use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
- Validate all input from external sources
- Apply whitelist patterns for trusted query formats

### SecureModelLoader Tests
This test suite validates the secure model loading functionality:

#### Test Cases
- Safe models can be loaded correctly
- Malicious models are blocked
- Models without signatures are rejected
- Models from untrusted sources are blocked
- Sandbox loading functionality works correctly

## Running Tests
Install testing dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.test.txt
```

Run all security tests:
```bash
python -m pytest src/tests/unit/security/
```

Run specific test suites:
```bash
python -m pytest src/tests/unit/security/test_sql_security.py -v
python -m pytest src/tests/unit/security/test_secure_model_loader.py -v
```

## Test Design Principles
- Tests focus on security requirements, not implementation details
- Each test validates a single security concern
- Tests use mocking to isolate functionality and avoid actual malicious code execution
- Follow TDD: tests define expected behaviors, implementation makes tests pass

## Recent Security Improvements
- Implemented comprehensive SQL injection protection
- Fixed pickling issues by moving model classes to module level
- Updated expected error message patterns to match implementation
- Ensured proper cleanup of test resources
