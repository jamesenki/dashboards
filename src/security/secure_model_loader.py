"""
Secure Model Loader for MLflow models.

This module provides a secure wrapper around MLflow's model loading functionality,
protecting against common security vulnerabilities:
1. Arbitrary code execution via malicious model files
2. Loading models from untrusted sources
3. Loading models without proper signature verification

It follows the principle of defense in depth with multiple security layers.
