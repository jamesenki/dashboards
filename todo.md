# IoTSphere Refactor TODO List

## Next Steps for Refactoring

### 1. Implement Additional Device Type Modules

Building on the successful pattern of the water heater implementation:
- [ ] Plant equipment module
- [x] Vending machines (Polar Delight) module - Basic implementation
- [ ] Electric motorcycles/vehicles module

Each implementation should follow the established pattern:
- Models (Pydantic)
- Services (Business logic)
- API endpoints (FastAPI routers)
- Unit tests (pytest)
- Frontend templates and components

### 2. Polar Delight Vending Machine Tab Implementation

#### Tab Navigation Structure
- [X ] Update detail.html to add tab content containers
- [X ] Implement tab switching in JavaScript
- [ X] Write E2E tests for tab navigation

#### Operations Summary Tab
- [ ] Create backend models for operations data
  - [ ] Create `/src/models/vending_machine_operations.py` with models for sales, usage, maintenance
  - [ ] Add validation for operations data models
- [ ] Add service layer methods
  - [ ] Create `/src/services/vending_machine_operations_service.py`
  - [ ] Implement operations summary, sales data, maintenance history methods
  - [ ] Add temperature trends and usage patterns analysis
- [ ] Implement API endpoint for operations summary
  - [ ] Create `/src/api/vending_machine_operations.py` router
  - [ ] Add endpoints for operations data, sales, maintenance history
  - [ ] Update main API router to include new endpoints
- [ ] Create frontend template section and JavaScript
  - [ ] Update Operations tab HTML with charts and tables
  - [ ] Create JavaScript to fetch and display operations data
  - [ ] Add interactive elements (sorting, filtering) for operations data
  - [ ] Implement data visualization with Chart.js
- [ ] Write unit and E2E tests
  - [ ] Model tests in `/src/tests/unit/models/test_vending_machine_operations_model.py`
  - [ ] Service tests in `/src/tests/unit/services/test_vending_machine_operations_service.py`
  - [ ] API tests in `/src/tests/unit/api/test_vending_machine_operations_api.py`
  - [ ] E2E tests in `/src/tests/e2e/tests/vending-machine-operations.spec.js`

#### Insights Tab
- [ ] Create insights models and service methods
- [ ] Implement API endpoints
- [ ] Build frontend with visualizations
- [ ] Add analytics components
- [ ] Write unit and E2E tests

#### Predictions Tab
- [ ] Create prediction models and service methods
- [ ] Implement API endpoints
- [ ] Build frontend with charts for visualization
- [ ] Add forecasting components
- [ ] Write unit and E2E tests

#### Remote Operations Cockpit
- [ ] Create command models and service methods
- [ ] Implement secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- [ ] Build interactive control panel UI
- [ ] Add real-time feedback mechanism
- [ ] Write unit and E2E tests with security validation

### 3. Enhance Dashboard Functionality

The main dashboard needs improvement to display aggregated statistics:
- [ ] Create data visualization components (charts/graphs)
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring capabilities
- [ ] Build device status summaries
- [ ] Add filter/search capabilities for devices
- [ ] Create alert system for device status changes

### 3. Authentication and User Management

Security implementation:
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] API security measures (OAuth2, JWT)
- [ ] Secure password handling
- [ ] Session management

### 4. Frontend Component Refinement

UI/UX improvements:
- [ ] Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- [ ] Additional UI components (cards, tables, forms)
- [ ] JavaScript interactivity for dynamic content
- [ ] Consistent design system implementation
- [ ] Accessibility compliance

### 5. Infrastructure and Deployment

Production readiness:
- [ ] Containerization (Docker)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Database migration strategy
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

### 6. Documentation

- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guides
- [ ] Developer documentation
- [ ] Deployment instructions
